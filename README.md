# Getting started
To use this app, You will need a HTTP and MySQL server. I recommend Xampp for windows or LAMP stack if You are using Linux. 
At the beginning place all the files in the right place (htdocs/ var/www folder) and create a database called "todo" containing table "list", which has two rows: "id"-type INT, -Auto Increment, "tasks"- type VARCHAR.

Then edit file conn.php and insert your MySQL Server adress as well as login and password for it.
